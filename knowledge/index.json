Markets move fast. Technology evolves faster. People struggle to keep up.\n\nThe solution isn't more information—it's better frameworks. AI-powered systems that take opaque processes and make them transparent, actionable, and scalable.\n\nConsider the typical product team: endless meetings about features, unclear priorities, and last-minute pivots. Now imagine a framework that:\n- Automatically surfaces the highest-impact decisions\n- Provides data-driven recommendations\n- Handles the busywork while humans focus on judgment calls\n- Learns from past decisions to improve future ones\n\nThis is the future we're building...\n\n---\n\n**Saved to:** `knowledge/ai/sample-ai-article.md`\n",
