# Job Search Positioning Narrative (3 Versions)

**Created:** February 21, 2026  
**Purpose:** Define compelling positioning for outreach across different company types  
**Target Roles:** Head of Design Operations, VP/Director of Design, Principal Design Technologist  
**Target Companies:** AI-native, design tools, enterprise SaaS

---

## VERSION 1: CONSERVATIVE (Enterprise SaaS)

**Best For:** Adobe, Figma, Salesforce, Workday, Atlassian  
**Tone:** Credible, experienced, proven track record  
**Focus:** Design operations excellence + team scaling

---

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**

I spent 12 years building and scaling global design and product teams at Pitney Bowes. Most recently, I led design operations for a 200+ person engineering organization across 8 timezones. I've built design systems from scratch, implemented design-to-development workflows that reduced handoff time by 40%, and scaled research teams through rapid growth.

Over the past year, I've been studying how AI transforms design operations—how teams scale, how designers adapt their workflows, and what operational changes are needed. I'm looking for a role where I can bring that operational expertise to lead a design organization through an AI transformation, not just implement tools.

**Why this resonates with enterprises:**
- Proven at scale (200+ team experience)
- Concrete metrics (40% handoff improvement)
- International complexity (8 timezones)
- System-level thinking (operations, not just design)
- AI transformation ready (studied it explicitly)

---

## VERSION 2: BOLD (AI-Native Companies)

**Best For:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Scale AI, Hugging Face  
**Tone:** Visionary, experimental, learning-focused  
**Focus:** AI-first design culture + rapid scaling + team autonomy

---

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**

I'm leaving enterprise design leadership to understand how AI changes team dynamics, creativity, and decision-making from the inside. I've led teams through digital transformation; now I want to understand AI transformation at a company that's building it in real-time.

I'm looking for a role where I can help scale a design organization in an AI-native culture—where designers work differently, where tools augment human creativity, and where operations serve the mission of shipping fast with a small, distributed team. I'm equally interested in being on the operations side or embedded with design teams figuring it out together.

**Why this resonates with AI-native:**
- Explicit curiosity about AI + design intersection
- Growth mindset (leaving behind what I know)
- Ready for ambiguity (no "we've always done it this way")
- Distributed/async ready (8 timezone experience)
- Cultural fit (learning, experimentation, speed)

---

## VERSION 3: TECHNICAL (Design Technologists & Emerging Roles)

**Best For:** Framer, Linear, Runway, companies hiring "Design Operations + Code" roles  
**Tone:** Technical, systems-thinking, product-focused  
**Focus:** Design as infrastructure + human-in-the-loop workflows

---

**Elevator Pitch (30 seconds):**

My background is design operations at scale, but I'm obsessed with how design systems become infrastructure for teams—and how AI forces us to re-architect what that infrastructure looks like. I've built design-to-code handoff automation, component governance at scale, and now I'm studying generative design workflows.

I'm looking for a role where operations isn't admin—it's a technical systems problem. How do you structure a design organization so AI augments creativity instead of replacing it? How do you maintain coherence in output while teams work async with AI assistance? That's the architecture problem I want to solve.

**Why this resonates with design technologists:**
- Systems-level thinking (infrastructure)
- Technical depth (automation, code)
- Architectural lens (not process tweaking)
- AI-plus-human focus (augmentation, not replacement)
- Problem-solving (not task execution)

## NARRATIVE ELEMENTS (Use Across All Versions)

### Key Themes to Emphasize

**1. Why You Left Pitney Bowes**
- "I had built the system. After 12 years, I needed to understand the next evolution."
- "Enterprise design operations is mature. I wanted to study where that field is heading."
- "I wanted breathing room to research and learn, not just execute."

**2. What You've Learned in the Gap Year**
- Studied AI + design systems intersection
- Built trading system to understand systems thinking at scale
- Analyzed design operations across 30+ companies
- Identified patterns in how teams scale with AI
- Recognized that operations is increasingly about human-in-the-loop workflows

**3. Your Unique Combination**
- Enterprise design operations (the hard part: 200+ people)
- Research/analytical skills (deep company research)
- Technical foundation (trading system, automation)
- AI curriculum knowledge (not just hype, studied it rigorously)
- Global team experience (not just co-located)

### How to Bridge Different Company Types

| Company Type | Opening Angle | Bridge Statement | Call-to-Action |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **AI-Native** | "You're building the tools we'll all use" | "I want to understand design at the frontier" | "I'd love to discuss how you're approaching design ops for an AI-first team" |
| **Design Tool** | "You're the infrastructure" | "Design tools are becoming operating systems for creative teams" | "I'm interested in how you think about design ops at your scale" |
| **Enterprise SaaS** | "You have the complexity at scale" | "Most teams don't think systemically about design operations" | "I'd love to bring that systems thinking to your design organization" |

## STORY ARC FOR INTERVIEWS

**Act 1: Enterprise (Where You've Been)**
- "I built design operations for a global team..."
- "The challenge: scaling without chaos..."
- "The solution: systems and governance..."
- **Result: We went from X to Y; here's what worked**

**Act 2: The Gap (What You Discovered)**
- "After 12 years, I stepped back to research..."
- "I studied how AI is changing design workflows..."
- "I built systems to understand systems thinking..."
- **Insight: The next evolution of design ops is about human + AI workflows**

**Act 3: Future (Why You're Here)
**
- "What interests me about your company..."
- "Here's how I'd approach design operations in your context..."
- "Here's what I think you're getting right (or missing)..."
- **Question: How are you thinking about this evolution?**

## TONE GUIDELINES

### Words to Use
- Systems, architecture, infrastructure
- Scaling, evolution, transformation
- Curiosity, learning, research
- Rhythm, momentum, flow
- Human-centered, augmented, collaborative

### Words to Avoid
- "I want to" (too aspirational)
- "Thought leader" (cliché)
- "Synergy" (corporate)
- "Best practices" (boring)
- "Disrupt" (overdone)

### Authenticity Check

Before you send any positioning, ask yourself:

- [ ] Does this feel true to my actual experience?
- [ ] Am I being specific (not generic)?
- [ ] Does it answer "why should they care?"
- [ ] Would I be excited to defend this in a room full of smart people?
- [ ] Does it reflect where I actually want to go?

## USING THESE NARRATIVES

### In Cold Outreach (LinkedIn DM)
Use **Version 1 or 2** depending on company. Keep to 2-3 sentences. Hook with specific insight about their company, then insert narrative as context.

**Example:**
"I've been following your product direction [specific detail]. I'm a VP Design Ops-level person with 12 years at Pitney Bowes, now focused on how AI changes design team workflows. I'd love to grab 30 min coffee to discuss how you're thinking about this. [Company-specific insight]. Would that be interesting?"

### In Warm Introductions
Use **Version 3 (Technical)** as it reads well as narrative without feeling salesy. Ask the introducer to emphasize: "systems thinker" + "studied AI + design intersection" + "wants to contribute, not just lead."

### In Interview Conversations
- **Screening call:** Use Act 1 of story arc (establish credibility)
- **Design conversation:** Use Act 2-3 (show research, ask good questions)
- **Final round:** Full story arc (why you left, what you learned, why this company)

### In Your Resume
One-liner that combines your unique strength:

"Design Operations Leader + AI Researcher: Built design systems for 200+ global teams; studied AI-first design workflows; seeking Head of Design Ops role to lead design organizations through next evolution."
