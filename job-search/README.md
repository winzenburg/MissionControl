## Strategic Positioning

**You are NOT:** Another design ops person looking for a role

**You ARE:** An architect who systematizes AI integration into design operations at scale

**Hedgehog Concept:**  
"I build AI-powered frameworks that turn complex, high-stakes uncertainty into clear, actionable decisions at scale."

**Key Differentiator:**  
Most design ops leaders understand process. Few understand AI transformation. You architect the intersection.
