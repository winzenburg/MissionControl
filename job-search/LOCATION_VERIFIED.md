## Remote Work Considerations

**Advantages of Remote (SF-Based Companies):**
- Access to top-tier design orgs (Figma, Notion, Linear)
- Higher compensation bands (SF market rates)
- Larger career networks and visibility
- Strong alignment with your Hedgehog concept

**Advantages of Colorado Companies:**
- Potential for occasional in-person collaboration
- Local networking and community building
- May offer relocation bonuses or Colorado-specific perks
- Growing Colorado tech scene (Boulder especially)

**Your situation:** Remote work from Golden, CO is ideal for the strongest Hedgehog-fit companies. Colorado companies are worth exploring as secondary targets.

## Recommendation

✅ **Proceed with current 5 contacts** - all are remote-verified and strongest Hedgehog fits.

Consider adding 2-3 Colorado companies (Guild, SonderMind, Strive Health) to create a balanced search:
- 70% focus on remote SF-based companies (better fits)
- 30% focus on Colorado companies (local advantage)
