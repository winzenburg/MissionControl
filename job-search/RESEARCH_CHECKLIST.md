## After Research

Once you have 10-20 names, I'll:
1. Update `data/contacts.json` with real names
2. Regenerate all outreach messages with proper personalization
3. You'll have 20 polished, ready-to-send messages

---

## Tips

- **Look for recent posts**: If they've posted about AI, design ops, or team scaling, note it for personalization
- **Check mutual connections**: If you have any, mention them in outreach
- **Note recent job changes**: New VPs are more likely to create roles
- **Secondary contacts**: If no VP/Head, look for "Director of Design" or "Senior Design Manager"

---

## Email Finding (Optional)

If LinkedIn profiles don't show emails:
- **Hunter.io**: firstname.lastname@company.com patterns
- **RocketReach**: Paid but accurate
- **Manual**: Check company "About" or "Team" pages

---

**Ready to start?** Pick a few companies and spend 15-20 minutes researching. Even 5 solid contacts is enough to test the system!
