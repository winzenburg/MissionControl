## Recruiter Outreach Template

**Subject:** AI-Augmented Design Operations Leader - Actively Seeking

Hi [Recruiter Name],

I'm reaching out because I noticed your focus on [design leadership / AI talent / tech executive search], and I'm actively seeking my next role in an emerging category: **AI-augmented design operations leadership**.

**What makes this role category unique:**

Most companies are asking "how do we adopt AI tools?" I help companies answer "how do we transform design operations when AI is core to workflows?" It's architecture, not just tool adoption.

**Target Roles:**
- Head of Design Operations
- VP/Director of Design
- Principal Design Technologist

**Target Companies:**
- AI-native companies with 15+ design teams (OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Scale AI)
- Design tool companies integrating AI (Figma, Notion, Linear, Framer)
- Enterprise/fintech transforming with AI (Stripe, Adobe, Salesforce, Databricks)

**What makes me uniquely positioned:**

Most design ops leaders understand process. Few understand AI transformation. I architect the intersection.

**Background:**
- Design operations: Aetna (healthcare), Pitney Bowes (fintech), Comcast Business (telecom)
- Current projects: 30-agent product creation engine (Cultivate), fintech-specific design system (kinetic-ui), caregiver SaaS (Kinlet)
- Hedgehog: "I build AI-powered frameworks that turn complex, high-stakes uncertainty into clear, actionable decisions at scale"

**Why this matters to recruiters:**

This is a rare skill intersection that's increasingly in-demand as companies realize AI isn't just a feature—it's an operations transformation. Companies struggling to scale design with AI need someone who can architect systematic operations, not just optimize existing processes.

**Search Criteria:**
- Compensation: $180k+ total comp
- Location: Remote or Colorado
- Stage: Well-established startup or enterprise
- Timeline: Actively interviewing

**Portfolio:** https://winzenburg.com

If you're working with companies navigating design operations transformation with AI, I'd love to connect and explore how I can add value to your search.

Best,

- Current: 30-agent product engine (Cultivate), fintech design system (kinetic-ui)
- Target: Head of Design Ops, VP/Director Design at companies transforming with AI

**Criteria:** $180k+, remote or Colorado, well-established startup or enterprise

**Why it matters:** Companies are realizing AI isn't just a tool—it's an operations transformation. I architect that transformation at scale.

If you're working with companies navigating this shift, I'd love to connect.

Best,

## Recruiter Qualification Questions

When a recruiter responds, qualify the opportunity by asking:

1. **Company stage:** "Is this company at the AI tool adoption phase, or the operations transformation phase?"
2. **Team size:** "How large is the design team? Do they have existing design operations infrastructure?"
3. **Role clarity:** "Has the company defined this role internally, or are they still exploring what they need?"
4. **Timeline:** "What's the hiring timeline? When are they hoping to have someone start?"
5. **Compensation:** "What's the target comp range? Does it align with $180k+ total comp?"

**Red flags:**
- "We're exploring AI tools" (too early, not transformation-ready)
- "Small team, no design ops yet" (not ready for your level)
- "Contract-to-hire" or "Freelance first" (not aligned with your search)
- Below $180k comp or unclear on budget

**Green flags:**
- "Transforming how design teams work with AI" ✅
- "15+ designers, need operations leader" ✅
- "Existing design systems, adding AI capabilities" ✅
- "$180k+ comp, full-time hire" ✅
