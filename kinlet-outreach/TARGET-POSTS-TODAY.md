**Voice feedback:**
- Does anyone say "this is spam"? (bad sign)
- Do people thank you? (good sign)

- No engagement after 12 hours = wrong timing or buried posts
- Engagement but no signups = CTA is unclear

## 📝 Response Templates

**If someone thanks you:**
> "Glad it helped. This stuff is so hard, and nobody prepares you for it. If you ever want to talk to other people going through the same thing, that's why I built Kinlet. But even if not, I hope the checklist helps."

**If someone asks a follow-up question:**
> "[Answer their question honestly and specifically]. If you want the longer version with more scenarios, I can DM you the full guide. Just let me know."

**If someone is skeptical of Kinlet:**
> "Totally fair. I'm not trying to sell anything here - the checklist is free and you can use it however you want. Kinlet is just peer support groups for people in this situation. If it's not for you, that's completely fine."

**If someone asks about pricing/features:**
> "It's peer support groups (6-8 people) matched by stage and relationship. We're forming the first groups this week - it's early, so we're keeping it simple. No therapy, no medical advice, just people who get it. If you want to check it out: https://kinlet.care"
