## 🎯 Voice Compliance (Every Piece is Ready)

All materials follow Kinlet voice guidelines:

✅ **Peer-level** (not expert-to-novice)  
✅ **Honest about struggle** (not toxic positivity)  
✅ **Specific pain points** (sundowning, grief, med battles)  
✅ **Warm + calm tone** (not urgent or salesy)  
✅ **Correct language:**
- Use: "what you're going through," "people who get it," "in this together"
- Avoid: "journey," "platform," "solution," "you've got this!"

**The Golden Rule:** Would you say this to a caregiver at their support group? If yes, send it.
