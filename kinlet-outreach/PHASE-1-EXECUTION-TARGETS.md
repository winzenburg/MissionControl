That's exactly why I built Kinlet. Small groups of people matched by stage and relationship. Everyone's caring for someone with Alzheimer's or dementia. Everyone gets it.

We're forming the first groups this week. If you're interested:

## 🚨 BLOCKERS & NOTES

### BLOCKER: Email to 9 Existing Signups
**Status:** CANNOT EXECUTE  
**Reason:** Need access to Kinlet admin dashboard to get signup email list + personalization data  
**Workaround:** Once admin access available, send same day (template ready in email-existing-signups.md)  
**Expected impact if blocked:** 9 existing signups × 2 referrals = 18 lost signups (but DM/Reddit outreach can compensate)

### BLOCKER: Unique Referral Links
**Status:** CANNOT ASSIGN  
**Reason:** Need admin panel to generate unique referral links for each prospect  
**Workaround:** Use generic Kinlet.care link for now, note which prospect clicked (via analytics)  
**Note:** Kinlet needs analytics tracking to attribute signups to sources

---

- ✅ 3 Reddit microguides (copy-paste ready)
- ✅ 5 DM templates (personalization + URLs provided)

## 📝 NEXT STEPS

1. **Get admin access** to Kinlet dashboard for signup list + referral links
2. **Execute Reddit posts** (Feb 21-22) - 30-40 min, expect 10-20 engagement per post
3. **Execute DM outreach** (Feb 22-28) - 15 DMs across 5 templates, expect 20-30% response rate
4. **Monitor engagement** daily - respond within 4 hours

6. **Document learnings** for Phase 2 (Week 2-3)

---

**STATUS:** Ready to execute. Awaiting admin access for email/referral links.  
**EXPECTED WEEK 1 OUTCOME:** 8-12 DM responses + 2-3 referral signups + 3-5 Reddit post signups = 13-20 new signups (on top of 9 existing)  
**CUMULATIVE BY END WEEK 1:** 22-29 signups (vs. 9 week 1 goal of 35-45, need to accelerate Week 2)
