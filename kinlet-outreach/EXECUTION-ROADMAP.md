## 🎯 Voice/Tone Compliance

Every piece of content MUST pass this checklist:

- [ ] Does this sound like a peer, not a company?
- [ ] Am I validating struggle, not selling solutions?
- [ ] Have I avoided "journey," "platform," "solution"?
- [ ] Have I avoided toxic positivity?
- [ ] Is the CTA natural and respectful?
- [ ] Would I say this at a support group?

**Key terms to use:**
- "What you're going through" (not "journey")
- "People who get it" (not "experts")
- "In this together" (not "you've got this")

**Key terms to avoid:**
- Journey, platform, solution, revolutionary, game-changing
- Toxic positivity: "you've got this!" "best day ever!"
- Clinical: care recipient, patient, treatment plan

- Negative Reddit comments ("this is spam," downvotes)
- <10% response rate on personalized outreach
- Signups but no email confirmations (deliverability issue)

- Voice feedback: "this sounds like marketing"

**If voice is off:**
- Re-read `docs/content/VOICE-TONE.md`

- Ask: "Would I say this to someone at a support group?"
