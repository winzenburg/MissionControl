My stepdaughter has severe dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. My sister struggles with mental health and addiction.

I've seen what happens when people face hard things alone.

That's why I'm building Kinlet. 🧵

Caregivers for people with Alzheimer's are the most isolated, exhausted people I know.

They need peer support. Not advice. Not platitudes.

Just: "I've been there. You're not alone."

The problem with existing solutions:

Forums are too big and unmoderated. Facebook groups have 50K people—how do you find someone in your exact situation?

Nonprofits are trusted but feel like homework.

Therapy is expensive and often not covered.

What caregivers actually need (from talking to 100+ of them):

• Small groups (6-8 people max)
• Matched by stage of diagnosis and relationship
• Moderated for safety
• Private (not performative)
• 15 minutes a day, not another 2-hour support group

That's Kinlet.

Small, matched peer groups for people caring for someone with Alzheimer's or dementia.

Not therapy. Not medical advice. Just peer support that actually fits your life.

The research is clear: matched peer support reduces caregiver burnout.

But existing solutions are too generic. Too big. Too overwhelming.

We're fixing that.

Here's what we built (MVP just launched):

• Challenge tags (🌅 Sundowning, 😔 Grief day, 🔁 Repetitive questions)
• Small win celebrations (balance the hard days)
• Burnout detection (self-care nudges after 7 consecutive hard days)
• Response prompts (help people support each other)

The voice matters.

We don't say "journey" or "care recipient."

We say "what you're going through" and "the person you're caring for."

We don't do toxic positivity ("you've got this!").

We do honest validation ("this is so hard").

Why I can build this:

• 20+ years in product design (Aetna, MapQuest, Comcast, Level 3, Pitney Bowes)
• Deep empathy from personal experience
• Research-backed (validated with caregivers before building)
• AI-assisted development (shipped MVP in weeks, not months)

Building in public. Following the journey (okay, I used the word 😅).

If you want updates on how this goes—first groups, lessons learned, what works—follow along.

And if you're a caregiver: join us. You're not alone. 💙

## ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS

### Shorter Version (6 tweets)

Caregivers for people with Alzheimer's are the most isolated, exhausted people I know.

Existing solutions: forums (too big), nonprofits (too much info), therapy (too expensive).

What they need: small, matched peer groups. People who get it.

That's Kinlet. 🧵

---

**Tweet 2/6**
Small groups (6-8 people) matched by:
• Stage of diagnosis
• Relationship (spouse, adult child, etc.)
• Specific struggles (sundowning, grief, repetitive questions)

Not therapy. Not advice. Just peer support.

We just shipped the MVP:

Why this matters:

My stepdaughter has severe learning differences. My sister struggles with mental health.

I know what happens when people face hard things alone.

Caregivers deserve better.

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

**When people reply:**

✅ **Do:**
- Thank them for sharing
- Answer questions honestly
- Offer to DM more details
- Retweet caregiver stories (with permission)

❌ **Don't:**
- Give medical advice
- Oversell the product
- Ignore critical feedback
- Get defensive

**Sample responses:**

**If someone shares their story:**
> "Thank you for sharing this. The [specific thing] you mentioned is so hard. If Kinlet could help, I'd love to have you in the first groups: [link]"

**If someone asks about features:**
> "Good question! [Answer]. We're keeping it simple at first—small groups, matched by stage, moderated. Not trying to be everything to everyone."

**If someone is skeptical:**
> "I get it. There are a lot of platforms that promise and don't deliver. This is just peer support. If it's not for you, that's totally fine. Appreciate the feedback."

## VOICE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before posting:
- [ ] Does this sound authentic, not salesy?
- [ ] Have I shared personal connection (not just features)?
- [ ] Have I avoided "revolutionary," "game-changing," "limited time"?
- [ ] Is the CTA natural and respectful?
- [ ] Would I post this if I weren't promoting Kinlet?

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Engagement:**
- 50+ likes = resonating
- 10+ replies = conversation started
- 5-10 signups = good conversion for 1st thread

**Amplification:**
- Retweets from caregiver advocates
- Quote tweets sharing personal stories
- Follow-on threads from others

**Red flags:**
- Replies calling it "another startup"
- No engagement = timing or voice is off
- Engagement but no signups = trust gap or unclear CTA
