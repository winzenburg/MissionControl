Hi [Username],

I saw your post about [specific detail from their post]. The sundowning is brutal.

## VOICE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before sending, verify:
- [ ] Does this sound like a peer, not a company?
- [ ] Am I validating their specific struggle (not generic)?
- [ ] Have I avoided "journey," "platform," "solution"?
- [ ] Have I avoided toxic positivity ("you've got this!")?
- [ ] Is the CTA natural and non-salesy?
- [ ] Would I send this to someone I met at a support group?

## PERSONALIZATION RULES

**Required personalization:**
1. [Username] → Their Reddit username
2. [specific detail] → Reference their actual post (quote a phrase they used)
3. [Your referral link] → Use their personal Kinlet referral code

**Timing:**
- Send within 24-48 hours of their post (while pain is fresh)
- Avoid late night (10pm-8am their timezone)

**Follow-up:**
- If no response in 3 days, move on (don't double-message)
- If they reply interested, give more details + explain matching process
- If they decline, respect it immediately

## SUCCESS METRICS

**Good response rate:** 20-30% (caregivers are time-poor)  
**Great response rate:** 40%+  
**Red flag:** <10% means voice is off or targeting is wrong
