"Sundowning isn't your fault. It's neurobiology—not anything you did wrong. 

When my mom gets agitated around 5 PM, I've learned to dim the lights 30 minutes earlier. Doesn't always work, but when it does, it's a small win.

What helps you during those late afternoon hours?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Sundowning","Twitter","2026-02-10T09:30:00-07:00"
"The hardest part isn't the caregiving tasks. It's watching someone you love slowly disappear while they're still here.

If you're feeling this grief, you're not broken. Anticipatory grief is real, and it's okay to mourn what's being lost.

You're allowed to feel both love and sadness at the same time.",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Grief","Twitter","2026-02-10T14:00:00-07:00"
"My dad asks me the same question 47 times a day. Some days I answer with patience. Some days I don't.

Both are okay.

If you're running out of patience with repetitive questions, that's not a character flaw—it's exhaustion. And exhaustion means you need support, not guilt.

What do you do when you're at your limit?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Burnout","Twitter","2026-02-11T10:00:00-07:00"
"I love my friends, but I've stopped trying to explain what caregiving is really like.

They mean well with 'You're so strong!' and 'I could never do what you do.' But sometimes I just want someone who gets it without having to teach them.

That's why I started looking for other caregivers. People who don't need the translation.

Where do you find your people?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Isolation","Twitter","2026-02-11T15:30:00-07:00"
"Respite care guilt is wild.

You're exhausted, you desperately need a break, someone offers help... and suddenly you feel like you're abandoning them.

Let me say it clearly: Taking a break doesn't make you a bad caregiver. It makes you a sustainable one.

You can't pour from an empty cup. (I know that's cliché, but it's true.)",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,RespiteCare","Twitter","2026-02-12T09:00:00-07:00"
"Things I wish I'd known before becoming a caregiver:

1. You'll make decisions you never wanted to make
2. You'll cry in grocery store parking lots
3. You'll become an expert in things you never wanted to learn
4. You'll meet the strongest, kindest people in support groups
5. Small wins will feel like massive victories

What would you add to this list?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,CaregiverWisdom","Twitter","2026-02-12T16:00:00-07:00"
"For those caring for a parent with Alzheimer's or dementia:

I see you answering the same question for the 30th time today.
I see you holding it together during doctor appointments.
I see you researching at 2 AM because you can't sleep.
I see you grieving someone who's still alive.

You're not alone in this. There are thousands of us navigating the same chaos.

And we get it.",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Support","Twitter","2026-02-13T11:00:00-07:00"
"Caregiver burnout isn't 'being a little tired.'

It's forgetting to eat. It's snapping at people you love. It's staring at the wall because you can't process one more decision.

If that's you right now, please know:
- You're not failing
- You're not weak
- You need help (and that's okay)

What does burnout look like for you?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Burnout","Twitter","2026-02-13T17:00:00-07:00"
"I used to think asking for help meant I couldn't handle it.

Now I know asking for help means I'm smart enough to recognize my limits.

You don't get bonus points for burning out alone. You just get burned out.

Who's in your support system? (And if the answer is 'no one,' let's change that.)",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Support","Twitter","2026-02-14T10:30:00-07:00"
"Reality check: Caring for someone with Alzheimer's is expensive.

Adult day care. Medications. Home modifications. Lost work hours. Respite care.

The financial stress is real, and it compounds the emotional stress.

If you're struggling with the cost of care, you're not bad with money—the system is broken.

What's the biggest financial challenge you're facing?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,FinancialStress","Twitter","2026-02-14T15:00:00-07:00"
"Some days you're a caregiver, a nurse, a therapist, a cook, a cleaner, a financial planner, a medical researcher, and a grief counselor.

And you're doing all of it on 4 hours of sleep.

You're not superhuman. You're just doing what needs to be done.

But you deserve recognition for how hard this is. So here it is: What you're doing matters. And it's really, really hard.",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Validation","Twitter","2026-02-15T09:30:00-07:00"
"Caregiving taught me that love isn't always gentle.

Sometimes it's holding boundaries when they're angry.
Sometimes it's making decisions they can't make anymore.
Sometimes it's crying in the car before going back inside.

Love shows up in a thousand unglamorous ways.

What has caregiving taught you about love?",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Love","Twitter","2026-02-15T14:30:00-07:00"
"If you're feeling guilty about putting your loved one in memory care, please hear this:

You are not abandoning them.
You are ensuring they get care you can't provide alone.
You are still their advocate, their family, their person.

Placement isn't failure. It's recognizing limits and choosing their safety.

You're still a caregiver. The role just looks different now.",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,MemoryCare","Twitter","2026-02-16T10:00:00-07:00"
"To the caregiver who feels invisible:

Your family doesn't see the midnight wakings.
Your friends don't understand why you can't just 'get away for the weekend.'
Your employer thinks you're distracted.

But I see you. We see you.

And what you're doing—every single day—is monumental.

You're not invisible here.",,,"Kinlet,Caregiving,Validation","Twitter","2026-02-16T16:00:00-07:00"
