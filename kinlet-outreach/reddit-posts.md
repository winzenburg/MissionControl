## Post 1: The 4pm-8pm Window (Sundowning)

**Title:** The 4pm-8pm window is brutal. Here's what actually helps.

**Body:**

Not advice. Not tips. Just validation.

If you're dealing with sundowning, you know. The aggression. The confusion. The same questions 47 times. The exhaustion.

I'm caring for my [mom/dad/etc.] and I've learned: **you need people who've been exactly where you are right now.** Not people who mean well. People who get it.

That's why I'm building Kinlet. Small peer groups (max 8 people) matched by stage of diagnosis and relationship. No judgment. No BS. Just support from people going through the exact same thing.

We're forming the first groups this week.

If this sounds like something you need: [link]

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Leads with pain, not solution
- ✅ Uses specific caregiver language ("47 times," "people who get it")
- ✅ Honest about what it is (small groups, not therapy)
- ✅ Peer-level voice (shares own experience first)
- ✅ Avoids salesy language

## Post 2: The Grief of Losing Them While They're Still Here

**Title:** The grief of losing them while they're still here

**Body:**

That specific pain. You know.

They're sitting right there. But the person you knew? They're gone. And nobody talks about that grief because "at least they're still alive."

I'm building Kinlet for people going through exactly this.

Small, matched peer groups (6-8 people) by stage and relationship. Not therapy. Not advice. Just people who understand.

We're forming the first groups this week.

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Names the specific, hard-to-articulate pain
- ✅ Validates ("nobody talks about that grief")
- ✅ Calm, honest tone (not dramatic or salesy)
- ✅ Clear boundaries (not therapy)

## Post 3: When They Ask Where Dad Is for the 47th Time

**Title:** When they ask where Dad is for the 47th time today

**Body:**

And you have to decide: do I tell the truth again and watch them grieve? Or do I make something up?

There's no good answer. Just exhaustion.

You need people who've been in that exact loop. Not people who mean well. Not advice. Just: "I've been there. You're not alone."

That's what Kinlet is. Small groups of people matched by what you're actually going through. Caring for someone with Alzheimer's or dementia. Same stage. Same relationship.

We're forming the first groups this week.

If you need this: [link]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Hyper-specific scenario (caregivers will nod along)
- ✅ Honest about the difficulty (no solutions-pushing)
- ✅ Peer validation, not expert advice
- ✅ Natural transition to product (not forced)

## Post 4: For Caregivers Who Feel Alone

**Title:** If you're caring for someone with Alzheimer's and feel completely alone

**Body:**

You're probably not posting much. You're too tired. Or you tried, and got advice you didn't ask for.

What you actually need: **people who get it without you having to explain.**

That's why I built Kinlet. Small peer support groups (max 8 people) matched by stage of diagnosis and your relationship to the person you're caring for.

No advice unless you ask. No toxic positivity. Just people who've been where you are right now.

We're forming the first groups this week.

Early access: [link]

---

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Speaks to the lurker/silent caregiver
- ✅ Validates why they haven't engaged yet
- ✅ Clear value prop (matched, small, peer-level)
- ✅ Sets boundaries (no unwanted advice)

## ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY

**When people comment:**

✅ **Do:**
- Thank them for sharing
- Acknowledge their specific struggle
- Answer questions honestly
- Offer more info via DM if appropriate

❌ **Don't:**
- Give medical advice
- Push the product hard
- Ignore critical comments
- Argue with skeptics

**Sample responses:**

**If someone shares their story:**
> "Thank you for sharing this. The [specific thing they mentioned] is so hard. I'm glad you're here."

**If someone asks a question:**
> "Good question. [Answer honestly]. If you want more details, I'm happy to DM you—don't want to spam the thread."

**If someone is skeptical:**
> "I get it. There are a lot of platforms promising things. This is just peer support—small groups, matched by stage. Not therapy, not medical advice. If it's not for you, that's totally fine."

## VOICE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before posting, verify:
- [ ] Does this sound like a fellow caregiver, not a company?
- [ ] Am I leading with pain/validation, not solution?
- [ ] Have I avoided "journey," "platform," "solution," "revolutionary"?
- [ ] Have I avoided toxic positivity?
- [ ] Is the CTA natural and respectful?
- [ ] Would I post this if I weren't promoting Kinlet?
