"I'm building Kinlet because I watched my stepdaughter struggle alone while caring for her grandmother with Alzheimer's.

She needed people who understood what 3 AM panic attacks about medication schedules felt like. Not advice. Just... someone who gets it.

That's the product. Matched support groups for family caregivers. Small, private, moderated.

Building in public starts now. 🧵",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,FounderStory","Twitter","2026-02-10T09:00:00-07:00"
"Market research update:

Spent 2 hours in r/Alzheimers and r/dementia yesterday. 47 posts analyzed.

Top 3 pain points that keep showing up:
1. Isolation (""my friends don't get it"")
2. Sundowning chaos (4-7 PM every day)
3. Guilt about respite care

Not one person mentioned 'community platforms.' They want people who understand. That's the insight.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,MarketResearch","Twitter","2026-02-10T14:30:00-07:00"
"Product decision: Why matched groups instead of open forums?

I've seen 500+ caregiver posts. The most helpful responses come from people in similar situations:
- Same disease stage
- Similar family dynamics
- Parallel struggles

A mom caring for her dad with early-stage Alzheimer's needs different support than someone navigating late-stage with a spouse.

Matching = relevance = trust.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,ProductDesign","Twitter","2026-02-11T10:00:00-07:00"
"Reality check: 11 million family caregivers in the US. $271B in unpaid care annually.

But here's what surprised me in research:

They don't want another checklist app. They don't want medical advice. They don't want 'self-care tips.'

They want to feel less alone. That's the core job-to-be-done.

Kinlet = social infrastructure for a massively underserved group.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,TAM","Twitter","2026-02-11T15:00:00-07:00"
"Tech stack for Kinlet MVP:

- Next.js + Vercel (fast deployment, Edge functions)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL + RLS for multi-tenancy)
- Clerk (auth with magic links for exhausted caregivers)
- PostHog (feature flags, analytics)
- OpenAI (challenge clustering, burnout detection)

Optimizing for speed to validation, not architectural perfection.

"User research insight:

Asked 9 caregivers: 'What would make you try a new support platform?'

Expected: 'Free trial' or 'Easy to use'

Actual top answer: 'If someone like me recommended it.'

Word-of-mouth is everything in this space. Trust is the moat.

Implication: Founder Cohort (first 50 users) is the entire GTM strategy.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,GTM","Twitter","2026-02-12T16:00:00-07:00"
"MVP feature I almost cut but kept: Unanswered Challenge Alerts

If someone posts and gets no responses within 24h, their match group gets a gentle nudge.

Why? Because silence = 'nobody cares' in the caregiver's mind. And that's the exact feeling we're trying to fix.

Small feature. Big psychological impact.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,ProductDesign","Twitter","2026-02-13T10:30:00-07:00"
"Founder dilemma:

Should I share my personal caregiving story in marketing? Or keep it professional?

On one hand: Vulnerability builds trust with caregivers.
On the other: I'm not the user. My stepdaughter is.

Leaning toward: Share the founder origin, but center actual caregiver voices in content.

How do you balance personal story vs. user-centric marketing?",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,Marketing","Twitter","2026-02-13T16:30:00-07:00"
"Validation strategy for Kinlet:

Phase 1: 50-100 trial users (Founder Cohort)
Phase 2: Track retention, engagement, referral rate
Phase 3: If viral coefficient hits 25-40%, scale. If not, iterate.

Hypothesis: Small, matched groups reduce isolation better than open forums.

If the hypothesis is wrong, we pivot. If it's right, we scale.

Simple, testable, fast.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,Validation","Twitter","2026-02-14T09:00:00-07:00"
"Cost to validate Kinlet: ~$5K

- Domain, hosting, tools: $500
- AI API usage (clustering, moderation): $1K
- Initial outreach ads (Reddit, Facebook): $2K
- Tools (research, design, dev): $1.5K

If we can't validate demand with 50 users for $5K, the market isn't there.

Low stakes validation before burning serious capital. That's the game.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,Bootstrapping","Twitter","2026-02-14T15:00:00-07:00"
"Feature I'm worried about: Burnout Detection

We use mood tracking + activity patterns to flag when someone's at risk.

Pros: Proactive support, intervention before crisis
Cons: Could feel invasive, 'big brother' vibes

Planning: Opt-in, transparent, user-controlled thresholds

How do you balance helpful automation vs. creepiness in health tech?",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,Ethics","Twitter","2026-02-15T10:00:00-07:00"
"Kinlet growth loop:

1. Caregiver joins, gets matched to small group
2. Group provides genuine support (isolation decreases)
3. Caregiver tells 2-3 other caregivers
4. Referrals join, cite the friend who invited them
5. Matched together when possible (trust boost)

Viral coefficient target: 25-40%

If we nail matching quality, the loop works. If not, it doesn't. Everything hinges on that.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,GrowthStrategy","Twitter","2026-02-15T16:00:00-07:00"
"Positioning challenge:

Kinlet isn't:
- A medical app
- A caregiving task manager
- A general mental health platform

Kinlet is:
- A social companion for family caregivers
- Peer support infrastructure
- A place to feel less alone

The tighter the positioning, the clearer the message. But does 'too narrow' mean 'too small'?

Betting on: Narrow and deep > broad and shallow.",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,Positioning","Twitter","2026-02-16T09:30:00-07:00"
"What I'm optimizing for with Kinlet:

Not: Viral growth at any cost
Not: Maximum engagement metrics
Not: VC-friendly growth curve

Instead: Genuine peer support that measurably reduces isolation

If we can prove that small, matched groups help caregivers feel less alone, the business model will follow.

Mission first. Metrics second. (But we're tracking both.)",,,"Kinlet,BuildInPublic,Mission","Twitter","2026-02-16T15:30:00-07:00"
