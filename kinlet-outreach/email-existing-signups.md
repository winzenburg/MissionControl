# Email to Existing 9 Kinlet Signups

**Subject:** We're forming the first groups this week

Hi [Name],

You joined the Kinlet waitlist a few weeks ago. Thank you for trusting us.

We're forming the first groups this week—small, matched support groups for people caring for someone with Alzheimer's or dementia.

**If you know someone who's going through this, they should join too.**

Here's your personal invite link:

When they join and confirm their email, you'll move up in line for the Founder Cohort (priority matching into the first groups).

No pressure. Just wanted you to know we're ready.

**P.S.** If you're not sure this is for you anymore, that's okay. Just reply and I'll remove you from the list.

**Why this works (Kinlet voice):**
- ✅ Peer-level: "You joined… thank you for trusting us" (not "we're excited!")
- ✅ Honest: "No pressure. Just wanted you to know" (not urgent/salesy)
- ✅ Practical: Clear next action (share link)
- ✅ Warm: Offers opt-out respectfully
- ✅ Avoids: "journey," "platform," "limited time"
