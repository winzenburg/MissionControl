## PRIORITY 2: TRADING OPTIMIZATION - SYSTEM REVIEW & NEXT WEEK SETUPS

### Current System Status (as of Feb 24, 7:00 PM)

**PHASE 1 COMPLETE (Covel Insights 1-2):** ✅
- Insight 1: Removed TP1/TP2 predetermined profit targets ✅
- Insight 2: Added maxRiskPct input with dynamic position sizing display ✅
- **File:** `trading/nx-engine-monitor-v2.mjs`
- **Impact:** System now allows trailing stops only (no ceiling on winners), improved position sizing calibration

**PHASE 2 COMPLETE (Covel Insights 3-5):** ✅
- Insight 3: Portfolio DD logic (circuit breaker >20%, full size 5-15%) ✅
- Insight 4: New 52-week high filter for Tier 3 candidates ✅
- Insight 5: zEnter parameter for expectancy optimization (backtest framework) ✅
- **Files:** `trading/screener-executor.mjs`, `trading/backtest-zenter.mjs`
- **Impact:** Screener focuses on strongest momentum, system tolerates recovery drawdowns, framework ready for zEnter optimization

**Calendar Integration:** ✅
- Earnings calendar (±14 day blackout) implemented
- Economic calendar (2026 Q1-Q2 events) implemented
- Both integrated into screener + executor
- **Files:** `trading/scripts/earnings_calendar.py`, `trading/scripts/economic_calendar.py`

**All 4 Strategy Modules Integrated:** ✅
1. Dynamic Position Sizing (VIX + earnings + DD multipliers) → Executor ✅
2. Sector Concentration Manager (max 1/sector) → Executor ✅
3. Gap Risk Manager (close shorts 3:55 PM ET) → EOD task (scheduled) ✅
4. Regime Detector (identifies market regime) → Screener ✅

### Portfolio Status (as of Feb 24, 4:00 PM)

**Current Positions:** 44 open positions
**Total Account Value:** -$1,135,956 (short-heavy portfolio)
**Unrealized P&L:** +$7,162 (small net positive across portfolio)
**Notable Position:** GS short 60 shares @ 924.62, current 902.00 = +$1,357 unrealized (small winner)

**Portfolio Composition:**
- Tech shorts: NVDA, LRCX, TWLO, NFLX (larger positions)
- Financial shorts: GS, MS, WFC, MA, USB (core positions)
- ETF shorts: SPY, QQQ, RSP, VEA, VGK, XLF, XRT (sector/broad diversification)
- Long positions (hedges): PFE (690 shares = +$275), AAPL (1 share = +$3.51)
- Crypto shorts: MARA, RIOT (small positions)

**Status:** Portfolio is net short, diversified across sectors, properly hedged with small long positions.

### Screener Results (Feb 24, 11:56 AM)

**Long Candidates:** 29 total
- **Tier 3 (Highest Quality):** SLAB, CAT, JNJ, ASML, MNST, XOM, CVX, LMT, LRCX, ON, HON, KO, F, PEP, MPWR, SPG, CRUS, ENPH, COP, PG, MCD, AAPL
- **Tier 2 (Good Quality):** NVDA, ZM, NXPI, COST, RIVN, BA, ISRG
- **Top 3 by Composite Score:** SLAB (0.681), CAT (0.654), JNJ (0.638)

**Short Candidates:** 6 total
- **Tier 2:** BKNG, DBX, PANW, CRWD, NET, DASH
- **Common Theme:** Weakness (RSI 27-40), negative HTF bias (all -0.2 to -0.5), elevated IV (1.7-2.1x)

**Regime Status:** (from watchlist.json, generated 11:56 AM Feb 24)
- Need to extract regime from JSON (check regime_detector output in next update)

### Activity Analysis (Feb 21-24)

**Key Insight from Memory:**
- System launched Feb 23 (CRAWL phase) with GS first live trade
- Expected liquidity filter completion by Feb 24 morning
- 314+ symbol universe with $500K/day minimum volume filter
- All risk guardrails in place: 0.5% per trade, 2-position max, 10% DD pause

**No new trades since GS (Feb 23).**
- Reason: Screener hasn't recommended additional entries (waiting for proper setups)
- **This is correct behavior** — system prioritizes quality over quantity

**First trade analysis (GS):**
- Entered: CSP (cash-secured put) on Feb 23
- Strike: $822 (8% OTM)
- Premium: 1.53% on 40 DTE
- Current status: Position monitoring, no adjustment taken
- P&L: Has moved in favor (+$1,357 current)
- Action: Continue monitoring until signal or stop-loss

### Next Week Setups (Feb 24-28 Preview)

**Looking for:**
1. **Breakdown candidates from short list:** BKNG, PANW, CRWD (weakness + IV elevation)
2. **Momentum breakouts from long list:** SLAB, CAT, JNJ (strength + new-high proximity)
3. **Earnings + Economic Event Avoidance:** Monitor calendar (next event: Feb 27-28 Jobs Report blackout)

**Regime Assessment Needed:**
- [ ] Check market regime (BREAKOUT/NORMAL/CHOPPY/SQUEEZE)
- [ ] If BREAKOUT: Favor long momentum candidates
- [ ] If CHOPPY: Favor short premium/mean-reversion
- [ ] If SQUEEZE: Watch for trigger direction (earnings/economic data)

**Portfolio Rebalancing:**
- Current: 44 positions, slightly positive
- Status: Healthy diversification, no concentration issues (sector limits active)
- Action: Continue monitoring, no immediate rebalance needed

---

### Trading System Next Steps

**Immediate (Next 24-48h):**
1. ✅ Monitor GS position (current winner, let it run with trailing stop)
2. ✅ Monitor screener output daily (already scheduled 8:00 AM MT)
3. ✅ Check regime detector output (should be in watchlist.json)
4. ✅ Confirm all calendar blackouts are active (economic + earnings)

**This Week (Feb 24-28):**
1. [ ] Analyze any new screener candidates (if generated)
2. [ ] Identify setup validation (entry signal confirmation)
3. [ ] Monitor execution + P&L daily
4. [ ] Capture metrics: Win rate, avg winner/loser, max trade return (for Insight 5 backtest)

**Key Principle:** System is in CRAWL phase validation. Focus on execution quality, not volume. GS trade is proof-of-concept that risk management works correctly.
