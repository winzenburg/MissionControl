## POSITIONING NARRATIVE MAPPING

### For Anthropic (PRIORITY 1)

**Opening Narrative:**
"I'm interested in how we design for uncertainty. Most product design assumes humans are making deterministic decisions — but with AI systems that learn and adapt, the design problem fundamentally changes. I want to work on designing _with_ AI, not just interfaces to AI."

**Why This Role (Design Ops):**
"As design ops, I can build the systems that enable your design team to scale while staying grounded in the complexity of designing for AI. That's exactly what I've been building frameworks to do — translate complex systems into working structures."

**Connection to CV:**
- "Systems thinking" → Design ops is about systems
- "Handling uncertainty" → Designing with AI is inherently uncertain
- "Building frameworks" → Design ops is framework-building
- "Scaling without losing nuance" → The core design ops challenge

### For Perplexity (PRIORITY 2)

**Opening Narrative:**
"I think search is about decision-making under uncertainty — which is what product design really is. I'm curious how AI changes that. Not search as information retrieval, but search as a decision support system. That's where I think the real design challenge is."

**Why This Role (Product Designer):**
"I want to work on products where AI and human intelligence are genuinely complementary. Search feels like the clearest case — the AI does what it's good at (synthesis), humans do what they're good at (judgment). Good design is orchestrating that dance."

### For Scale AI (PRIORITY 3)

**Opening Narrative:**
"Data infrastructure is boring until you realize it's actually about governance and decision-making at scale. The design problem isn't making something pretty — it's making something trustworthy. That's what I care about."

**Why This Role (Product Designer):**
"Enterprise design is about making complex systems transparent. That's my jam. I want to design data tools that help teams make better decisions with confidence."

## NOTES & OBSERVATIONS

**Strategic Insights:**
1. **Anthropic is your best fit** — Joel Lewenstein's public presence + Design Ops opening + Safety culture alignment
2. **Perplexity is most accessible** — Founder-driven, tech community connections easier
3. **Mike Krieger at Anthropic is a signal** — He values builders + product thinking (your positioning angle)
4. **Design Ops is underrated** — High leverage, fewer applicants, plays to your strengths

**Risk Assessment:**
- Not a PM by title (but your thinking is PM-like)
- No traditional SaaS experience (but AI companies care less about this)
- Smaller total experience than typical industry hires (offset by depth + framework thinking)

**Confidence Level:** 7/10 (clear positioning, good networks, but job search is long-game)
