## 🚀 Major Milestone: Trading System Launch Scheduled

### Interactive Brokers + TradingView Integration Complete

**What we built today:**
- Full paper trading automation system
- Connected IB Gateway (port 4002) to paper account DU4661622
- Webhook listener running on port 5001
- Screeners scheduled via cron (8:30 AM, 12 PM)

- **Time:** 7:45 AM MT (market open)
- **Mode:** Paper trading (no real money)
- **Position Size:** 1 share per trade (learning mode)
- **Strategy:** User's swing trading setups with filters

**The Deal:**
User wants aggressive optimization. Better trading performance = more profitable = better AI models for OpenClaw. Win-win incentive alignment.

**My Role:**
1. Run screeners automatically during trading hours
2. Send user top 10 setups daily for manual trading
3. Approve trades that pass filters (RS ratio, volume, watchlist, hours, regime)
4. Execute approved trades (starting 1 share)
5. Track performance and scale position sizing based on results:
   - 55% win rate → 10 shares
   - 65% win rate → 25 shares
   - 75% win rate → 50 shares
6. Daily performance reports
7. Aggressive optimization to maximize profit

**Safety:**
- Paper account only (no real money)
- Trading hours: 7:45 AM - 1:45 PM MT only
