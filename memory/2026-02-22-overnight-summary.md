## WORK COMPLETED

### 1. KINLET CUSTOMER DEVELOPMENT - PHASE 1 GTM ✅ READY TO EXECUTE

**What was done:**
- ✅ Reviewed all existing GTM materials (3 Reddit guides, 5 DM templates, email template)
- ✅ Identified 6 specific high-value Reddit target posts with URLs
- ✅ Created engagement tracking system (daily log template)
- ✅ Created Reddit posting checklist (step-by-step, copy-paste ready)
- ✅ Created admin access checklist (what's needed for email outreach)
- ✅ Documented execution timeline (Feb 23-28)

**Files created:**
1. `memory/2026-02-22-overnight-gtm-execution.md` (9K) — Master GTM plan
2. `kinlet-outreach/KINLET-engagement-log.md` (9.4K) — Daily tracking template
3. `kinlet-outreach/KINLET-REDDIT-POSTING-CHECKLIST.md` (11.3K) — Reddit execution guide
4. `kinlet-outreach/KINLET-ADMIN-ACCESS-CHECKLIST.md` (6.8K) — What's needed for emails

**Execution timeline (Feb 23 onwards):**
- **Sunday 7:00 AM:** Post 3 Reddit microguides (30-40 min)
- **Sunday 11:00 AM:** Monitor engagement + respond
- **Sun-Fri Feb 24-28:** Execute 15 personalized DMs across 5 batches
- **Wed Feb 26:** Email 9 existing signups (once admin access available)
- **Fri Feb 28:** Week 1 GTM summary

**Expected outcomes:**
- **Minimum:** 13-20 new signups (Reddit + DMs only)
- **Target:** 26-40 new signups (if email outreach enabled)
- **Cumulative by Feb 28:** 22-49 total signups (vs. 9 starting)

**Critical blocker:** Admin access to Kinlet dashboard (need email list + referral links)  
**Backup plan:** Execute without email (still ~20-30 signups) and track manually

**Confidence level:** 8/10 (materials are excellent, Reddit voice is proven, execution is straightforward)

---

### 2. TRADING OPTIMIZATION - WEEKEND ANALYSIS ✅ FRAMEWORK READY

**What was done:**
- ✅ Analyzed macro environment (Fed, sector rotation, volatility outlook)
- ✅ Identified 4 trading setup types for next week (gap fill, breakouts, rotation, volatility)
- ✅ Created risk management checklist
- ✅ Mapped economic calendar (PCE Wed, PMI Fri — volatility catalysts)
- ✅ Documented screener refinement recommendations
- ✅ Created daily/weekly trading roadmap

**File created:**
1. `memory/2026-02-22-trading-optimization.md` (9.5K) — Complete trading plan

**Key trading focus (next week):**
- **Monitor:** PCE data (Wed 10:30 AM EST) for potential volatility spike
- **Setup 1:** Gap fill opportunities (firewood is dried, ready to light)
- **Setup 2:** Momentum breakouts (ride the wave on strong sectors)
- **Setup 3:** Sector rotation plays (Energy/Financials if inflation tame)
- **Setup 4:** Volatility plays (if VIX spikes on inflation data)

**Screener improvements needed:**
- Reduce false signal rate (target: 25% vs. current ~40%)
- Add volume confirmation (require >1.5x avg)
- Add sector filter (avoid fighting headwinds)
- Add time filter (focus on 9:30-11:30 AM best liquidity)

**Daily execution (Mon-Fri):**
- Pre-market scan (8:00-9:30 AM)
- Market hours execution (9:30-4:00 PM)
- Post-market review (4:00+ PM)

**Risk management:** 1-2% risk per trade, defined stops, take profits at first target

**Confidence level:** 7/10 (good framework, but execution depends on market conditions)

---

### 3. JOB SEARCH - POSITIONING & TARGET RESEARCH ✅ EXPLORATORY FRAMEWORK READY

**What was done:**
- ✅ Articulated positioning narrative (Hedgehog → job market translation)
- ✅ Defined ideal role profile (function over title)
- ✅ Identified 5 target company categories (20+ companies to research)
- ✅ Created outreach strategy (3 phases over 3 months)
- ✅ Documented positioning assets needed (case studies, articles, personal brand)
- ✅ Created 30-day action plan

**File created:**
1. `memory/2026-02-22-job-search-research.md` (13K) — Complete job search framework

**Target company categories:**
1. Fintech + Wealth Management (7 companies: Brex, Ramp, Mercury, etc.)
2. Healthtech + Caregiving (8 companies: Included Health, Honor, Papa, etc.)
3. AI Infrastructure (7 companies: Anthropic, Scale AI, Hugging Face, etc.)
4. Education + Learning (5 companies: Coursera, Maven, Epistemic Games, etc.)
5. B2B SaaS (7 companies: Datadog, Figma, Linear, Notion, etc.)

**Why these:** All solving high-stakes uncertainty problems aligned with Hedgehog concept

**Positioning assets to create (Mar-May):**
1. 2-3 case studies (portfolio + narrative)
2. 2-3 public articles (Medium/Substack on design systems + AI)
3. Twitter/personal brand presence (thought leadership)

**Outreach timeline:**
- **Feb-Mar:** Research + positioning
- **Mar-Apr:** Warm intros + relationship building
- **Apr-May:** Exploratory conversations
- **May+:** Formal interviews (if interest)

**Compensation expectations:** $180-250K salary + 0.5-1.5% equity = $250-350K total comp

**This is NOT urgent** (build optionality, not desperation)  
**Success = conversations with 2-3 companies, choice of best fit**

**Confidence level:** 7/10 (clear positioning, good networks, but job search is long game)

## WHAT'S BLOCKED vs. WHAT'S GO

### BLOCKED (Waiting for external resources)
- ❌ Email to 9 Kinlet signups (need admin dashboard access + referral links)
- ❌ Unique referral tracking (need analytics setup)

### GO (Ready to execute immediately)
- ✅ Post 3 Reddit microguides (Sunday 7 AM)
- ✅ Send 15 personalized DMs (daily Feb 23-28)
- ✅ Monitor engagement + respond (daily)
- ✅ Execute trading setups (daily Mon-Fri)
- ✅ Start job search research (March 1)

**Blocker is NOT critical:** Can execute 90% of Phase 1 GTM without email outreach.  
**Backup plan:** Capture emails manually in signup form, track referrals by asking "who referred you?"

## LEVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES (Phase 2, Mar+)

Once Phase 1 validates:

1. **Kinlet Reddit content → Organic loops**
   - Viral posts attract more DMs
   - DM responses lead to signups
   - Signups share Kinlet with friends (3x multiplier)

2. **Trading setups → Market opportunities**
   - Best performing setups → Build standalone trading bot?
   - Screener refinement → Sell as indicator? (longer term)

3. **Job search → Consulting/advisory?**
   - Conversations with companies → Advisor role?
   - Blog/Twitter presence → Attract inbound?

**Not the focus now, but keep in mind for future leverage.**

| **Kinlet DM GTM** | 7/10 | Targeting | 70% (needs personalization) |
| **Kinlet Email GTM** | 6/10 | Admin access | 40% (blocked on dependency) |
| **Trading optimization** | 7/10 | Market conditions | 70% (framework solid) |
| **Job search** | 7/10 | Timing | 75% (good research, slow market) |
