## SCREENER REFINEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### Current Screeners Status
Based on your custom Pine Script indicators:

**Screener 1: Gap Fill Setups**
- Current criteria: [YOUR CRITERIA]
- False signal rate: [~%]
- Win rate: [~%]
- Recommended adjustment: [IF NEEDED]

**Screener 2: Momentum Breakouts**
- Current criteria: [YOUR CRITERIA]
- False signal rate: [~%]
- Win rate: [~%]
- Recommended adjustment: [IF NEEDED]

**Screener 3: Daily Range/Volume Profiles**
- Current criteria: [YOUR CRITERIA]
- False signal rate: [~%]
- Win rate: [~%]
- Recommended adjustment: [IF NEEDED]

### Refinement Recommendations

Based on your Hedgehog concept (turning uncertainty into clarity), screeners should:
1. **Reduce noise** - Lower false signal rate (currently tracking at ~40%? Target: 25%)
2. **Increase clarity** - Higher conviction signals (focus on >70% probability setups)
3. **Improve timing** - Better entry precision (avoid early entries, catch momentum shift)

**Specific tuning options:**
- [ ] Increase RSI threshold for oversold entries (e.g., 30 → 35)
- [ ] Add volume confirmation (require >1.5x avg volume on breakout)
- [ ] Filter by sector momentum (avoid fighting sector headwinds)
- [ ] Add time filter (e.g., only trade 9:30-11:30 AM EST for better liquidity)

## NEXT WEEK TRADING SETUP IDENTIFICATION

### Setup Type 1: Gap Fill Opportunities

**Scan for (Feb 24-28):**
- Stocks that gapped up >2% on low volume last week
- Now consolidating/pulling back to fill gap
- Entry: On test of 50% retracement
- Target: Full gap fill or previous resistance
- Stop: Above gap high + buffer

**Sectors to watch:** Financials, Energy (Trump admin tailwind)  
**Candidates:** [To be identified with TradingView scan]

**Risk/reward:** Typically 1:2 to 1:3 if timed well

---

### Setup Type 2: Momentum Breakouts

**Scan for (Feb 24-28):**
- Stocks in >13-week breakout (new highs)
- Breaking above daily 20-SMA with >1.5x avg volume
- Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) confirming
- Entry: On breakout close above resistance
- Target: 1-2 recent swing highs above
- Stop: Below 20-SMA support

**Sectors to watch:** Tech (megacap strength), Healthcare (stable), Utilities (defensive)  
**Candidates:** [To be identified]

**Risk/reward:** Typically 1:2 (lower risk, consistent)

---

### Setup Type 3: Sector Rotation Plays

**Macro thesis (Feb 24-28):**
- Energy/Financials may continue rotation if inflation data hot (PCE on Wed)
- Tech may consolidate if rates rise (higher rates = lower multiples)
- Defensive sectors (Utilities, Consumer Staples) may underperform

**Trading implication:**
- Look for **relative strength** plays (XLE outperforming XLK)
- Look for **ratio breaks** (commodity prices breaking down = energy weakness)
- Avoid fighting the sector trend (don't short strong sectors)

**Setup:** Long strongest in sector (e.g., XLE leader) + short weakest in other (e.g., XLK laggard)

---

### Setup Type 4: Volatility Expansion Plays

**Watch for (Feb 24-28):**
- VIX breaking above 20 on PCE inflation data (Wed 10:30 AM)
- Creates opportunity for mean-reversion trades
- Or run-and-hide if data is shocking

**Setup if VIX spikes:**
- [ ] Long put spreads on VIX (if inflation data is tame)
- [ ] Long volatility stocks (UVXY, XIV) if data is hot
- [ ] Avoid holding through data — too risky

**Probability:** 30-40% chance of VIX spike (low probability, high reward if it happens)

## SCREENER PERFORMANCE TRACKING

### Last 2 Weeks Performance
| Screener | # Signals | Wins | Losses | Win % | Avg R:R | Status |
|----------|-----------|------|--------|-------|---------|--------|
| Gap Fill | [#] | [#] | [#] | [~%] | [1:X] | [Good/Poor] |
| Momentum | [#] | [#] | [#] | [~%] | [1:X] | [Good/Poor] |
| Vol Profile | [#] | [#] | [#] | [~%] | [1:X] | [Good/Poor] |

**Analysis:**
- Which screener is most profitable? (Focus on this)
- Which has highest false signal rate? (Adjust this)
- Which aligns best with your style? (Double down on this)

## MACRO SETUP FOR NEXT 2 WEEKS

**Bull Case (60% probability):**
- Inflation data (Wed) comes in line or below expectations
- Fed stays neutral, no rate hikes expected
- Earnings season continues to beat
- Sector rotation pauses, tech consolidates near highs
- **Trade:** Long breakouts, momentum plays, gap fills

**Bear Case (40% probability):**
- Inflation data (Wed) comes in hot, Fed signals tighter bias
- Earnings expectations drop (recession fears)
- Sector rotation accelerates into Energy/Financials
- Tech pulls back 5-10% to consolidate
- **Trade:** Short rallies, take profits on longs, short weakness

**Base Case:** Bias to bull, but reduce position sizes into Wed data. Avoid large overnight positions until we know inflation trajectory.

## IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES

### Screener tuning (Week 1 focus):
- [ ] Reduce false signal rate by 10-15 percentage points
- [ ] Add volume confirmation (require >1.5x average)
- [ ] Add sector filter (avoid fighting sector headwinds)

### Trade execution (ongoing):
- [ ] Improve entry precision (waiting for 2nd dip for better entry)
- [ ] Improve position sizing (1-2% risk rule)
- [ ] Improve profit taking (lock in at 50% of target, let rest run)

### Journal discipline (weekly):
- [ ] Log EVERY trade (even 1-minute scalps)
- [ ] Note what you saw vs. what the screener said
- [ ] Track best performing setups (focus on these)
