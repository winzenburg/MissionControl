# Job Search Research & Positioning — Feb 22, 2026

**Status:** Positioning narrative drafted + target company research initiated  
**Timeline:** Exploratory phase (not urgent, but proactive research)  
**Goal:** Build optionality for next 6-12 months

---

## POSITIONING NARRATIVE

### The Hedgehog Concept (Refresher)
> I build AI-powered frameworks that turn complex, high-stakes uncertainty into clear, actionable decisions at scale.

### How This Translates to Job Positioning

**What I'm best at:**
- Translating complexity into usable systems
- Bridging strategy, UX, and emerging tech (especially AI)
- Seeing second-order effects others miss
- Designing practical leverage points
- Rapidly prototyping and validating ideas

**What deeply motivates me:**
- Making opaque systems legible (markets, tech, institutions, life paths)
- Helping people navigate inflection points with agency and clarity
- Building frameworks that let others think better
- Exploring frontier zones: AI, macro shifts, alternative life/career paths

**Economic engines:**
- Advisory, platforms, and products that reduce uncertainty
- AI-augmented tools that compress time, cost, or cognitive load
- Education and decision support for high-stakes choices
- Scalable systems rather than one-off services

### My Strongest Angle
**High-trust insight → repeatable systems → asymmetric upside**

This is what companies should hire me to do.

## TARGET ROLE PROFILE

### Ideal Role (Not a job title, but a function)
- **Title might be:** Product Director, Head of Design, VP Product, Chief Designer, AI Product Strategist
- **Company size:** 20-500 people (early-stage SaaS to growth-stage)
- **Stage:** Series A-C (enough resources to execute, young enough to move fast)
- **Market:** Fintech, Healthtech, Caregiving tech, B2B SaaS

### Responsibilities I Want
1. **Design systems that reduce uncertainty**
   - Build products that help people make better decisions under complexity
   - Design for clarity, not just aesthetics

2. **Bridge product + strategy + technology**
   - Translate market complexity into product roadmap
   - Own customer outcomes, not just features
   - Lead AI integration thoughtfully (not just hype)

3. **Leverage AI as a decision-support tool**
   - Design workflows that augment human judgment
   - Build frameworks that compress decision-making time
   - Think about second-order effects of AI (not just first-order features)

4. **Mentor + influence across org**
   - Shape how org thinks about design + product
   - Build design systems that scale thinking, not just UI
   - Elevate design literacy in the org

### Compensation Expectations
- **Salary:** $180-250K (depending on stage/equity upside)
- **Equity:** 0.5-1.5% for Series B/C role (meaningful but diluted)
- **Total package:** Goal is $250-350K total comp (salary + equity @ 4-year cliff)

### Deal-Breakers
- ❌ Title-only roles (VP with no real influence)
- ❌ Pure ops/execution roles (want to shape strategy)
- ❌ Companies with legacy tech stack (want to move fast)
- ❌ Roles where design is afterthought (need design-first culture)

**Effort required:** 5-10 hours/week (not replacing Kinlet/Cultivate/Trading work)

**Success = optionality:** Multiple companies interested, can choose best fit

---

## NOTES FOR RYAN

1. **Don't position as "looking for a job"**
   - Frame as: "Exploring what's next" or "Open to conversations"
   - This gives you power (you're evaluating them, not desperate)

2. **Leverage your unique angles:**
   - Product Designer who trades (unique perspective on uncertainty/risk)
   - Built multiple products (Kinlet, Cultivate, Design System)
   - Deep empathy for complex user situations (care-giving tech)
   - AI-forward thinking (not just catching up)

3. **Value add first:**
   - Demonstrate value through public writing/thinking
   - Help people without asking for anything
   - Build relationships, not transactions

4. **Know your walk-away price:**
   - Would only move for right role + team + comp
   - Not moving for title or prestige alone
   - Better to stay independent than take wrong role

---

**Status:** Framework ready for March activation  
**Next step:** Write 1-2 public articles on design systems + AI product thinking  
**Optionality timeline:** March research → April conversations → May decisions
