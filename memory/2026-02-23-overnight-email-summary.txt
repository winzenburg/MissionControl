PRIORITY 3: JOB SEARCH — TARGET COMPANY RESEARCH & POSITIONING REFINEMENT
=================================================================================

RESEARCH COMPLETE: Tier 1 (4 companies) + Overview of Tier 2/3

TIER 1 SCORING (Priority Order):

1. ANTHROPIC (San Francisco) — BEST FIT ⭐
   Culture Fit: 9/10
   Growth Potential: 9/10
   Design Leadership: 9/10
   Accessibility: 7/10
   Overall Score: 8.5/10

   - Head of Product Design: Joel Lewenstein (public podcast presence)
   - Open Role: Design Operations Lead (Built In NYC)
   - Culture: Safety-first, research-driven, growing team
   - Warm Intro Path: Possible via Joel Lewenstein or venture network
   
   Why This Fits:
   - Mike Krieger hiring culture values design + systems thinking
   - Design ops role plays to your framework-building strength
   - Joel's podcast signals design-forward product
   - Safety culture aligns with thoughtful, systems-level approach
   
   Recommended Positioning:
   "I'm interested in how we design for uncertainty. With AI systems that learn and adapt, the design problem changes fundamentally. I want to work on designing _with_ AI, not just interfaces to AI."

2. PERPLEXITY (San Francisco) — HIGH GROWTH, ACCESSIBLE
   Culture Fit: 8/10
   Growth Potential: 8/10
   Design Leadership: 7/10
   Accessibility: 8/10
   Overall Score: 7.75/10
   
   Key Info:
   - CEO: Aravind Srinivas (public, tech community connections)
   - Stage: Series C (well-funded, growth phase)
   - Focus: AI-powered search, enterprise API
   - Culture: Speed, agility, founder-driven
   - Warm Intro Path: Product hunting community, venture network
   
   Why This Fits:
   - Search is decision-making under uncertainty
   - Design-forward product (search UX matters)
   - More nimble than OpenAI, warmer intro paths
   - Growth phase (more hiring, faster movement)
   
   Recommended Positioning:
   "Search is about decision-making under uncertainty — which is what product design really is. I'm curious how AI changes that. Not search as information retrieval, but search as a decision support system."

3. SCALE AI (San Francisco) — PROFITABLE, INTERESTING DATA PROBLEM
   Culture Fit: 7/10
   Growth Potential: 8/10
   Design Leadership: 7/10
   Accessibility: 7/10
   Overall Score: 7.25/10
   
   Key Info:

   - Stage: Series D (well-funded, scaling)
   - Focus: Data infrastructure for AI, enterprise AI ops
   - Culture: Enterprise sales-focused, profitable
   - Warm Intro Path: Venture network, enterprise software community
   
   Why This Fits:
   - Data infrastructure = governance + decision-making at scale
   - Enterprise design = making complex systems transparent
   - Profitable path (less runway concerns than pure research)
   - Secondary option if Anthropic/Perplexity don't materialize
   
   Recommended Positioning:
   "Data infrastructure is boring until you realize it's about governance and decision-making at scale. The design problem isn't making something pretty — it's making something trustworthy."

4. OPENAI (San Francisco) — LARGEST SCALE, LOWER DESIGN FOCUS
   Culture Fit: 7/10
   Growth Potential: 10/10
   Design Leadership: 6/10
   Accessibility: 5/10
   Overall Score: 7/10
   
   Key Info:
   - Valuation: $200B (post-Series D, Feb 2025)
   - CEO: Sam Altman (very public)
   - Stage: Scaling from startup to org (bureaucracy emerging)
   - Culture: Less design-forward than Anthropic
   - Warm Intro Path: Difficult (venture capital network mainly)
   
   Why This Fits (Medium):
   - Largest scale + resources
   - Working with frontier reasoning models (o1/o3)
   - Risk: Large org, less design-centric culture
   
   Tertiary option — keep in back pocket but prioritize Anthropic/Perplexity

TIER 2 QUICK OVERVIEW (Not Researched Tonight):
