# Trading Rules (Scaffold)

Author: Ryan + Mr. Pinchy • Last updated: TBD

## Setups

### 1) Trend Following — EMA + Volume (example)
- Entry: 50 EMA crosses above 200 EMA; MACD bullish; volume > 1.5× 20‑day avg
- Stop: 2× ATR(14) below entry OR below last swing low (choose one; please confirm)
- Targets: 3R base; trail using 20 EMA or higher‑low structure once +2R
- Time stops: Exit before earnings; optional T+3 if no progress (>−0.5R to +0.5R band)
- Confidence threshold: ≥ 0.75
- Notes: Avoid entering within first 5–15 mins; skip on FOMC days

### 2) Box Breakout (placeholder)
- Entry: Close above box high with volume expansion (>1.3× 20‑day)
- Stop: Below box low
- Targets: 2R to 3R; partial at 1.5R
- Confidence: ≥ 0.8

### 3) Conservative Pullback (placeholder)
- Entry: Pullback to rising 20 EMA after higher‑high; reversal candle with volume ≥ prior 3‑bar avg
- Stop: Below pullback low
- Targets: Prior high (partial), trail remainder

Add/Reduce rules (global)
- Add: Only if initial risk is reduced (stop moved to break‑even) and trend intact
- Reduce: On clear failure signals (engulfing against, loss of structure), or when macro event risk increases

Exclusions
- Skip tickers with earnings within 48h (unless setup is explicit earnings play)
- Avoid thin names (<$5M avg daily dollar volume)

Please provide your final definitions for each active setup; placeholders above will be replaced with your specifics.
